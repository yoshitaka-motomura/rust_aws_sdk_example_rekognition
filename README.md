# AWS SDK for Rust Example
This example demonstrates how to use the AWS SDK for Rust

## Overview

The AWS SDK for Rust was made generally available a while ago, so I decided to try it out.
I'm trying to get a photo label using rekognition.

I am getting it from an object located in S3.

## Prerequisites
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
